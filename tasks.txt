Current progress
Able to load unweighted graphs and print nodes using their id
Add a second list of each that holds the weight 
Add a graph creator for testing 
Eliminate duplicate edges and get to offset array +  edges array form 
Map the graph from memory to a file 
Retrieve a file created
Add reading from my memory mappping implementation to the ready mst program


New Task 
Use lib to convert edge lists to csc

Steps
Use lib to read matrix market format OK
Convert matrix market (COO) to csc OK
Add a new read to matrix_market.c to read from the edge lists of the lab OK
    -Recognize c, p, a lines
    - c header
    - p sp number of nodes and edges
    - a edge line  
Add a new coo_to_csc to be compatible with the csc format of the mastiff algorithm (very simple)
